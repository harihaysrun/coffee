# Coffee
Can't decide which coffee to drink?

# Project name and summary
"What coffee should I drink today?" is a question I found myself asking rather frequently. The feeling of drinking the same coffee over and over again gets pretty mundane over time. On weekdays, cold brew. On weekends, cold brew again. Life won't be too interesting if I were to keep drinking the same coffee every day for the rest of my life.

This inspired me to start "Where's my coffee?", a randomiser that recommends the user a type of coffee and shop, so that they can go on to explore that shop's menu or perhaps even make an order with them. There's more than just Starbucks and Coffee Bean, people...
